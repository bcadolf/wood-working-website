            <h3>Types of Wood</h3>
            <p>Wood can be broken down into two main categories: Hardwood and Softwood. Each have their own general
                purpose and use. Hardwood is normally best for things that need to last. Decks, homes, furniture,
                flooring, cabinets. Anything that needs to stand a beating hardwood is normally the place to start.
                Softwood is easier to work with at the start. Carving a piece of Basswood is far easier than some Desert
                Ironwood. Softwood also has the advantage of being lighter so it is easier to carry and move anything
                made of it. If you just want to relax and don't care too much about the end result softwoods are great
                for many projects. You can also delve into the exotic woods the ones with natural grain patterns that
                look nice or great natural color or just a high price tag cause that's what people like. First thing you
                should do I go to a library or google and start looking up common wood species in your area. I would
                also try to find a good place to buy some, lumberyards, sawmills, wood supply shops, Esty. Just
                AVOID THE BIG CHAINS (Lowe's and home depot I am looking at you ðŸ‘€) their wood has been some of the
                worst quality I have ever dealt with. </p>

            <h3>The Big Why</h3>
            <p>Every woodworker needs to ask themselves why they want to do this. Is it for the money? The projects to
                make? Kicks n giggles? Or just something casual to pass the time? Regardless of the reason you should
                understand a little more about what wood working is. The craft of working with wood has been around for
                a long time. Some of the earliest wood items found date back to 780 thousand years ago. Some things have
                changed others not so much. Woodworking in essence is taking wood and shaping it to fit our desires.
                Whether that be a carving, a bowl, or a structure. No matter the method you choose to get the desired
                result what matters is your goals.<br>There are 3 main things you should know before you start.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Wood can be DANGEROUS. More than just a bad splinter. Some woods are toxic, others are brittle and
                    can shatter with tools, the dust produced can be so fine it can slowly kill you. All these things
                    can be avoided with proper safety precautions. When appropriate wear gloves, safety glasses, dust
                    masks, and other protective equipment. You should always asses the risks of what you are doing
                    before you do it.</li>
                <li>You get out what you put in; not always what you want. Wood is only so forgiving. If you cut off a
                    piece that you did not mean to, either the plans will change or you start over cause that piece
                    ain't going back on. The amount of effort you put into projects will affect how the projects can
                    turn out. The other portion that affects this is your skill level and that comes with time. Being
                    careful and methodical will always help your projects turn out the best you currently can make.</li>
                <li>This is a semi-renewable hobby. Wood is a renewable resourceâ€¦ sometimes. Realize each one of those
                    pretty lines in the wood takes approximately 1 year to form. A lot of the wood you can work with is
                    older than you. This means that you need to source it responsibly. Don't just go carving up every
                    tree and then after you claim your piece let the rest go to scrap. Take the time to find wood that
                    is harvested responsibly, where they either take fallen wood or trees that must come down for other
                    purposes and then turn that wood into the projects. Some places will also plant a new tree each time
                    one is removed. This will help ensure that woodworking can continue for another 780 thousand years.

            <h3>Types of Tools</h3>
            <p>You gotta join a club:<br>Power Tools or Hand Tools<br>Well not really but as you start you will find
                yourself favoring one over the other for certain tasks. If I need precise cuts or holes for joints, I do
                it by hand; planing the wood smooth hand me a power tool all day. Some people are the exact opposite.
                You will have to find your happy medium. And realize no matter which you choose quality tools will
                always be expensive. (Start with low quality then work your way up.)</p>
