                <h3>Where it all began.</h3>
                <p>This all began as a child with just a pocket knife and a stick. Most likely due to forgetting the
                    skewers to make s'mores on a camping trip. I quickly progressed from skewers to makeshift spears as
                    a child. Cause you knowâ€¦ pointy sticks were more fun. This evolved into smaller things such as
                    animals, words carved into decorations, and later into jewelry such as rings and necklaces. I still
                    have some wood from the first odds and ends box with some partially completed projects just waiting
                    for me to resume them. Still have my first detailed project too.</p>

                <h3>Where I am now.</h3>
                <p>Now I am no longer a child or teenager. Time is a lot harder to come by when you have a job and a
                    child. My projects have also changed in scale. As must as I wish to sit and slowly carve away, power
                    tools same time, and allow me to feel like I make progress on my projects even if I only have a few
                    minutes to do something. My son cares less about the tiny animals and enjoys putting together the
                    table and chair made just for his size. My passion for woodworking is still there the projects have
                    changed and will continue to change just as I am changing. </p>
